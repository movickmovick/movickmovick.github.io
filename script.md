FADE IN:

INT. JUSTIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see Justin, a teenage boy, lying on his bed. He is surrounded by various blue objects, including a blue pillow, a blue blanket, and a blue stuffed animal.

Justin picks up a blue crayon and begins to color a drawing of himself. As he colors, we hear his inner monologue.

JUSTIN (V.O.)
I've always been obsessed with being painted blue. It's my favorite color, and it just makes me feel calm and happy.

Suddenly, Justin's mother enters the room. She looks at Justin's drawing and raises an eyebrow.

MOTHER
Justin, what are you doing?

JUSTIN
I'm coloring myself blue, Mom.

MOTHER
But why?

JUSTIN
Because I love the color blue. It's just so...cool.

MOTHER
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to paint yourself blue. It's not natural.

JUSTIN
But Mom, I really want to be blue. Please let me.

MOTHER
I'm sorry, Justin. The answer is no.

Justin looks disappointed.

JUSTIN
Fine. But I'll find a way to be blue, even if it's not with paint.

CUT TO:

INT. JUSTIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see Justin sitting on his bed, wearing a blue shirt and blue pants. He is surrounded by various blue objects, including a blue rug, a blue lamp, and a blue bedspread.

JUSTIN (V.O.)
I may not be able to paint myself blue, but I can still surround myself with blue. It may not be the same, but it's the next best thing.

Suddenly, Justin's best friend, Alex, enters the room. He looks at Justin and laughs.

ALEX
Dude, why are you wearing all blue?

JUSTIN
Because I love the color blue.

ALEX
But it
